<b>TODO:</b><br>
<ul>   <li>Global field name - "gc" or "GC"? </li>
   <li>Determine the exact needs of the new set of TypeInfo classes. </li>
   <li>Allocator free - inner blocks? &lt;- No idea what I meant here </li>
   <li>init/shutdown API - need to be global </li>
   <li>Ensure that all references to "allocator" in the documentation
        refer to the <span class="crossreference"><u>Allocator</u></span> structure.
   </li>
   <li>Aligned allocation </li>
   <li>Optional generation of scanning code rather than bitmaps? If so,
        <b><u>MUST</u></b> be shared globally, perhaps by representing the
        bitmap as a base64-esqu symbol name?
   </li>
   <li>stopIgnoringThread? </li>
   <li>Look at destructor handling again, original design failed to
        account for user attempts to invoke the destructor of a non-GC
        allocation.
   </li>
   <li>Change the way allocators are setup - Each allocator no longer
        owns just one page, may own many pages.
   </li>
   <li>Reserve &amp; (extend &amp;| realloc) API </li>
   <li>Add a way to obtain information about an allocation:
        <ul>          <li>Is an inner slice? </li>
          <li>Total size? </li>
          <li>Base pointer? </li>
          <li>Extendable amount? </li>
        </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Decide whether to move all settings into an inner structure
        when making the settings into properties, due to the fact
        that some settings require other settings to be set, and to
        avoid causing issues with the GC, due to the fact it may
        attempt to do something modified by a setting while the user
        is still setting all the settings they wanted, the order that
        the other settings are set is crucial to the correct functioning
        of the GC.
   </li>
 </ul>

<br><br>
<b>Goals:</b><br>
<ul>   <li><b>Speed</b> - Above all, the GC needs to be fast, if this means that some code
                     will need to be dynamically generated to avoid branch mispredictions,
                     so be it.
   </li>
   <li><b>Minimize Impact</b> - The GC needs to strive to achieve the minimum possible impact
                               on user code by using strategies such as concurrent marking
                               and preemptive collections.
   </li>
   <li><b>Extensible</b> - The GC needs to be able to coexist both peacefully, and cleanly,
                          with Andrei's allocators.
   </li>
 </ul>

<br><br>
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
<ul>   <li>While it is allowed to change the internal API of the GC drastically, and
        silently, it must be a taboo to make a silent breaking change for user code.
        It is however perfectly allowed to make a nice loud breaking change for user
        code.
   </li>
   <li>While grammar extensions are welcome, grammar changes are heavily discouraged. </li>
 </ul>

<br><br>
<b>Term Notes:</b><br>
<ul>   <li>In the scope of this document, <b>finalizers</b> and <b>destructors</b>
        are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing. No distinction
        is made in terminology between heap and stack allocated value finalization.
   </li>
   <li>Unless otherwise obvious, the term <b>allocator</b> refers to
        GC allocators.
   </li>
 </ul>

<br><br>
<b>Major Differences:</b><br>
<ul>   <li>There is no way to allocate initialized memory; instead the
        caller is responsible for initializing the memory.
   </li>
   <li>Due to the need to be able to work with a unified type info
        interface for structs, delegates, arrays, classes, pointers,
        etc., the current <span class="crossreference"><u>TypeInfo</u></span> classes have been completely
        re-written from the ground up.
   </li>
   <li>All allocations are guarenteed to have their finalizers called
        before the program exits, provided that the program is not
        terminated abnormally, such as by a segfault, an unhandled
        <span class="crossreference"><u>Exception</u></span>, or the OS killing the process.
        <div class="gc_impl_detail">The last few (up to the number of cores - 1)
        threads left running may be hijacked to run any remaining finalizers
        before they are allowed to exit along with the main thread.</div>
   </li>
   <li>Allocations and exceptions in finalizers are allowed, however
        please not that exceptions will trigger a fatal error
        <span class="gc_todo">unless a user-defined handler is set</span>.
   </li>
   <li>Finalizers for heap-allocated structs will be invoked. </li>
   <li>Destructors will have 2 possible places in the method where
        they can start, the first makes a call to <span class="crossreference"><u>markFinalized</u></span>
        and then falls through to the second place, which is what a
        call to a destructor on a stack-allocated value will call.
   </li>
 </ul>

<br><br>
<b>Concessions Made:</b><br>
<ul>   <li>Compacting will not be supported with the current design. It
        is feasible to modify the API sometime in the future, due to
        the extremely limited amount of code that would break, however
        the time investment required for the design is currently better
        spent designing the core of the GC that will actually be used.
        The API does however take the steps necessary to allow user
        code to be written with compacting in mind. Please note that
        while the pinning API will currently do absolutely nothing,
        that may be changed in the future, and user code should be
        written under the assumption that the pinning API does indeed
        function, and is required.
   </li>
 </ul>

<dl><dt><big><a name="GC"></a>class <u>GC</u>;

<dd>This is the core of the <u>GC</u>.
<br><br>
It manages the interaction with the OS, freeing empty pages,
 when to collect, <span class="gc_todo">and if a precise or conservative
 collection should be performed</span>. It is also the only part of
 the <u>GC</u> that normal D code will be interacting with. The core
 of the <u>GC</u> here is entirely non-locking, instead using CAS or
 dirty-read logic. While this non-locking design is not required
 of <span class="crossreference"><u>Allocator</u></span> implementations, it is heavily preferred.<br><br>

<dl><dt><big><a name="GC.pinAllocation"></a>void <u>pinAllocation</u>(void* <i>allocation</i>);
</big></dt>
<dd>Ensure that an allocation will not be moved by a compacting
 allocator during a collection.
<br><br>
For each invocation of this method referencing the same
 allocation, a call to <span class="crossreference"><u>unpinAllocation</u></span> must be
 performed in order to allow the underlying allocator to <span class="gc_clarify">once
 again move the allocation</span>.

<br><br>
<b>Params:</b><br>
<table><tr><td>void* <i>allocation</i></td>
<td>A potentially interior pointer to the allocation to pin.</td></tr>
</table><br>
<b>Note:</b><br>
This will not prevent an allocation from being collected;
 for that use <span class="crossreference"><u>addRoot</u></span>.
 This also will not prevent it from being copied by a call
 to <span class="gc_todo">realloc/extend</span>, <span class="gc_clarify">as it is assumed that the caller
 of those methods will update whatever references to the
 allocation are required</span>.

</big></dt>
<dd>This method tells the GC to neither stop, nor scan the
 specified thread during a collection.
<br><br>
An example of a thread that would be suitable to being
 marked as not scanned would be an external thread that
 does only manual memory management, never allocating
 through the GC, and will neither access or modify any
 allocations created through the GC that have not been
 added as roots.

<br><br>

<b>Implementation Details:</b><br>
<div class="gc_impl_detail">This will be one of the instances
 of dynamic code-gen with a fallback for unsupported platforms.
 Due to the fact there should only be a small number of threads
 being ignored by the GC, we will statically expand all thread
 IDs into pairs of cmp &amp; setne instructions, as this will eliminate
 all possible cases where the CPU could mispredict a branch or
 even a return when checking to see if a thread is ignored.</div><br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.markAsReferenced"></a>void <u>markAsReferenced</u>(void* <i>allocation</i>);

 that the allocator that called this is allowed to immediately
 free the memory used by this <i>allocation</i>.
<br><br>

 If <b>false</b>, then the allocator that calls this must not mark
 the memory used by <i>allocation</i> as free, and instead must ensure
 that <i>allocation</i> is not freed. It must also ensure that <i>allocation</i>
 is only ever passed to this method once, otherwise multi-finalization
 will occur.<br><br>

</dd>

 passing <i>allocation</i> as-is.
<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
This method <b><u>MUST NOT</u></b> be called from user code,
 nor should it be called by the GC; instead it is to only
 be called by the prologue generated for finalizers.

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.releaseAllocator"></a>void <u>releaseAllocator</u>(Allocator* <i>allocator</i>);
</big></dt>
<dd>Release the page of memory allocated to a GC allocator.
<br><br>
The allocator being released is responsible for ensuring
 that all allocations it owns have been properly finalized
 and are indeed free before passing itself to this. It is
 not guaranteed that the memory owned by the allocator will
 be immediately freed, it may be cached for later use.

<br><br>
<b>TODO:</b><br>
This method may need to go away<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.collect"></a>void <u>collect</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd> This method will trigger a full collection, and will block
 the invoking thread until both the mark and sweep phases
 have completed. If a truely complete collection is required,
 and there are a large number of objects requiring finalization,
 such as when changing maps in a game, it is suggested to do:
<pre class="d_code">GC.<u>collect</u>();
GC.waitForPendingFinalizers();
GC.<u>collect</u>();
</pre>
 This allows the allocations with finalizers to also be freed.
 It is not recommended for non-finalizer heavy code to do this,
 as it will trigger 2 full collections.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.waitForPendingFinalizers"></a>void <u>waitForPendingFinalizers</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>This method will block the invoking thread until all
 pending finalizers have been invoked.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b><br>
It is likely that the invoking thread will be used
 to invoke some of the pending finalizers, so it should
 not be assumed that a thread calling this method will
 sleep until all finalizers are invoked.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.takeOwnership"></a>void <u>takeOwnership</u>(Allocator* <i>allocator</i>, void* <i>location</i>, size_t <i>length</i>);

 allocator should be assumed to own the specified block
 of memory, and any references to the block of memory
 should be handled by <i>allocator</i>.
<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
It is permitted to pass the same <i>location</i> in multiple times
 with different lengths, in which case the last <i>length</i> passed
 in is assumed to be the current length, however <i>allocator</i> must
 be the exact same. This is done in order to allow allocators
 that succeed in allocating contigious blocks of memory to be
 looked up as effeciently as is possible.

<br><br>

<b>Throws:</b><br>

 was already owned by another allocator, or else if the block of
 memory overlaps with another owned block of memory.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.releaseOwnership"></a>void <u>releaseOwnership</u>(void* <i>location</i>);
</big></dt>
<dd>This method is used to tell the GC that the previously
 provided allocator owns pointers to values at <i>location</i>.
<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
Allocator implementation must not return the memory to
 the OS until this method has returned, otherwise it creates
 a possible situation where another allocator was given the
 same block of memory before the current allocator has
 released ownership of it.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.enable"></a>void <u>enable</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>This method is used to enable automatic garbage collection
 if it has previously been disabled by a call to <span class="crossreference"><u>disable</u></span>.
<br><br>
It is required to call this method once for every call to
 <span class="crossreference"><u>disable</u></span> in order to re-enable the GC.

<br><br>
<b>Throws:</b><br>
GCAlreadyEnabledError if this method is called when the GC
 is already enabled. This is done to prevent code which has
 imbalanced enable/disable logic from silently succeeding
 when the GC is already enabled.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.disable"></a>void <u>disable</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>This method is used to disable automatic garbage collection.
<br><br>
It is required to call <span class="crossreference"><u>enable</u></span> once for every call to
 this in order to re-enable the GC. This is done to allow specific
 functions in large libraries (<b>not Phobos</b>) to disable and
 re-enable the GC for whatever reason they wish, without causing
 any code invoking it, which may also have a reason to disable
 the GC, to have to re-disable the GC after calling that method.<br><br>

 the error passed to it.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.onFreeOwnershipError"></a>void delegate(FreeOwnershipError error) <u>onFreeOwnershipError</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>This delegate is invoked when an <span class="crossreference"><u>Allocator</u></span>'s <span class="crossreference"><u>free</u></span>
 method is passed a pointer to an allocation for memory not actually
 owned by it.
<br><br>
This should never happen if the GC is working correctly,
 however, as <span class="crossreference"><u>Allocator</u></span>s are expected to throw this, there
 needs to be a way to handle it.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.asyncSweepEnabled"></a>bool <u>asyncSweepEnabled</u>;

The GC will also attempt to, when applicable, unblock the
 thread that triggered the collection as soon as possible.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="GC.preemptiveCollectionsEnabled"></a>bool <u>preemptiveCollectionsEnabled</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>If <b>true</b>, then the GC may attempt to preemptively perform
 a collection, in order to avoid blocking a future allocation
 request due to the need to run a collection pass.
<br><br>
